# 🚀 Project Name

A **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)** application built in **C#** following the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern.  
This project was made with the purpose of learning WPF and MVVM... It is a json editor that features CRUD operations and forms a JSON with file data (any file).

Example Generated Json:

```json
[
   {
      "Name":"Testasset1.bmp",
      "Type":".bmp",
      "Path":"F:\\PersonalProjects\\JSON_Editor\\src\\DemoAssets\\Testasset1.bmp",
      "SizeB":0,
      "Tags":[
         "Tag1",
         "Tag2"
      ]
   },
   {
      "Name":"TestAsset2.txt",
      "Type":".txt",
      "Path":"F:\\PersonalProjects\\JSON_Editor\\src\\DemoAssets\\TestAsset2.txt",
      "SizeB":0,
      "Tags":[
         "Tag1"
      ]
   }
]
```
